# ENHPATHY Event IV - Hands-on session on analyzing single-cell data
EPFL course by Vincent Gardeux

<br/>

In recent years, single-cell transcriptomics has become a widely used technology to study heterogeneous and dynamic biological systems. A large number of new tools and approaches have been developed for analyzing this new type of data.

The goal of this hands-on session is to provide theoretical and practical knowledge in the basic analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets.

This course covers the standard analysis of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset using the Seurat pipeline.
It follows to some extent the ["standard tutorial from Seurat"](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html), which we encourage the readers to consult when they want to dive more into single-cell data analyis.

In this course, we will use an example data set consisting of 7,000 cells from the ["Fly Cell Atlas"](https://flycellatlas.org/) repository. These cells all come from the **Body** part, which was dissociated as a whole and sequenced using 10x Genomics technology over 10 batches, mixing males and females.

This set of 7,000 cells was carefully selected/filtered from the original **Body dataset** that consists of 96,926 cells. They belong to *a certain number* of differently annotated cell types.

After a short introduction to single-cell genomics, and more particularly single-cell transcriptomics, we will go to and R exercise together.

***

At the end of this session, the participants should be able to:
- have a global knowledge of what is single-cell genomics, and in particular single-cell transcriptomics,
- have a good understanding of the generic analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq,
- repeat the same type of analysis achieved during the mini-project,
- present the mini-project and more globally disseminate their experience to the members of their group.


**Pre-requisites - background knowledge**
- Intermediate/advanced usage of R is a plus

**Pre-requisites - material & software**
- The participants must use a laptop with install permissions (admin). R and Rstudio should be installed on their machine. Two packages need to be installed, with their dependencies:
```r
install.packages("Seurat")
install.packages("data.table")
```
